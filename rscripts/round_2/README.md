## Usage

If you want to explore or run the code, I would recommend starting with 
`rscripts/1_initial_setup.R` to understand the distribution and layout of the 
original data and then running in order after that in order to see the 
development and creation of the different types of models. I would finish off
by looking at `rscripts/4_model_analysis.R` through 
`rscripts/6_assess_final_model.R` to see how each model performs, 
looking at which has the most accuracy. Otherwise, all of the associated model 
data, fitted data, tables of the performance analyses, and the recipes in which
I created can be found in their respective rscripts.
