## Regression Prediction Problem

Welcome to my regression prediction problem repository! This project is dedicated to addressing the prediction problem of Airbnb prices using a comprehensive dataset of airbnb booking data. Through rigorous analysis and model development, we have identified key insights and culminated in selecting a Random Forest model and Boosted Tree model as our top performers, achieving impressive `MAE` values of 50.79 and 46.91, respectively. Thus delving into the intricacies of predictive modeling in the rental home business, striving to contribute valuable insights to the field.
